# **9.1 Arrays and Strings**

Array questions and string questions are often interchangeable.

## 9.1.1 Hash Tables

**Hash table should be at the ***TOP*** of your mind when you meet a problem.**

[Vedio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs0KM3wKv8&list=PLI1t_8YX-Apv-UiRlnZwqqrRT8D1RhriX&index=13) explains hash table well by the author.

**Hash Table:** Maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup.

### Process:

**Key -> hash code -> index -> get value**:
Compute the hash code from the key, and then compute the index from the hash code. Then, search through the linked list for the value with this key.

### Running time:

If the number of collisions is very high, the **worst case** runtime is **O(N)**, where N is the number of keys. However, we generally assume a good implementation that keeps collisions to a minimum, in which case the lookup time is **O(1)**.

## **IQs 1.1 Is Unique**: 
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

Hints: #44, # 117, # 132

- 44: Try a hash table.
- 117: Could a bit vector be useful?
- 132: Can you solve it in O(N log N) time? What might a solution like that look like?
