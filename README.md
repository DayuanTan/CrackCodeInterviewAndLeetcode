# Notes:

## I.    The interview process

### 1.1 Few notes
Algorithm and coding problems form the largest component of the interview process. Usually you get through 1 question.

You **should** do your best to **talk out loud** throughout the problem and **explain** your thought process. 
    
- Your interviewer might jump in sometimes to help you; let them. It's normal and doesn't really mean that you're doing poorly. (That said, of course not needing hints is even better.)

### 1.2 Assessment

Rather, your interviewer will make an **assessment of your performanc**e, usually based on the following:

- **Analytical skills:** Did you need much help solving the problem? How optimal was your solution? How long did it take you to arrive at a solution? If you had to design/architect a new solution, did you structure the problem well and think through the tradeoffs of different decisions?

- **Coding skills:** Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code? Was it clean and well-organized? Did you think about potential errors? Did you use good style?

- **Technical knowledge / Computer Science fundamentals:** Do you have a strong foundation in computer science and the relevant technologies?

- **Experience**: Have you made good technical decisions in the past? Have you built interesting, challenging projects? Have you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?

- **Culture fit / Communication skills:** Do your personality and values fit with the company and team? Did you communicate well with your interviewer?
